Overview

This project is my completed take-home assignment for the Principal Software Engineer – Frontend role for Tacnique / Ajackus.

The goal was to implement the “All Candidates” page based on the provided Figma design, following best practices for:

Component architecture

State management

Client-side filtering & pagination

UI consistency using TailwindCSS

Clean, maintainable TypeScript + React code

FastAPI backend integration

The solution closely matches the visual design while maintaining extensibility and readability for production-level systems.
